# Lains-KNIGHTS
Lains Knights is/was a game made in Core with Lua language and then translated to actually be run by Unreal Engine.

After a few months there was no real interest in the community (which was very small at the time) nor from the Core Team who pushed for more of a pay to win scenarios...

The game got some recognition, won a few rewards as the D&D game jam and a few others for a good starting tutorial etc.

Currently there is no interest to continue this project, but if someone finds the code interesting to check how was a few things done in Core, well here you can inspect the code.
